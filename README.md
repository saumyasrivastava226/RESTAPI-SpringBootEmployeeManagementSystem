# RESTAPI-SpringBootEmployeeManagementSystem


I designed and implemented a REST API using SpringBoot framework . The API allows users to perform functionality, such as creating, reading, updating, or deleting data through HTTP requests.

The API has 9 REST END-POINTS in total. I incorported 4 HTTP( PUT,GET,POST,DELETE) methods. 
Created a JUnit Test case for checking the repository unit's functionality. 
The following are the functionalities available : Read all employees(GET method), Read employee by ID(GET method), Read employee by Name(GET method), Read Employee by Keyword, Update Employee(PUT), Delete Employee by id(DELETE method) , Create employee(POST method).
